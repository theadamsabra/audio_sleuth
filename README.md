# Audio Sleuth 

A torch based open-source framework for detecting audio generated from generative systems. The overarching goal of this repository is to be a toolbox for datasets, augmentations, and pretrained baseline models to assist researchers in the task of audio deepfake detection.

TODO:

- [ ] Have augmentations support label alignment. 
- [ ] Test Half truth dataset class
- [ ] Add dataset to Huggingface
- [ ] Train model on half truth
- [ ] Add wave fake
- [ ] Add dataset to Huggingface
- [ ] Train model on wave fake
- [ ] Add sing fake when uploaded - ask @ ICASSP 2024
- [ ] Add codec based augmentation
- [ ] Make pip package
