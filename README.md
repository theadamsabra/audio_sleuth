# Audio Sleuth 

A torch-based open-source framework for detecting audio generated from generative systems. The overarching goal of this repository is to be a toolbox for datasets, augmentations, and pretrained baseline models to assist researchers in the task of audio-based deepfake detection.

TODO:

- [ ] Make `duration_sec` optional for base class
- [ ] Test Half truth dataset class
- [ ] Add dataset to Huggingface
- [ ] Train model on half truth
- [ ] Add wave fake
- [ ] Add dataset to Huggingface
- [ ] Train model on wave fake
- [ ] Add sing fake when uploaded - ask @ ICASSP 2024
- [ ] Make pip package
