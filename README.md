# Audio Sleuth 

A torch-based open-source framework for detecting audio generated from generative systems. The overarching goal of this repository is to be a toolbox for datasets, augmentations, and pretrained baseline models to assist researchers in the task of audio-based deepfake detection.

TODO:
    - [] Add bash scripts for downloading HAD
    - [] README for HAD
    - [] Create simple baseline model, training script, evaluation set
